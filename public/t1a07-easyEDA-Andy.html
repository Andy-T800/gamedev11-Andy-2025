about JLCPCB and easyEDA research what they are used for.<br> 
Also include information about the RAKWIRELESS RAK3112 modules

<h2>What is JLCPCB and what is it used for?</h2>
<p>
JLCPCB is a PCB manufacturing and assembly service that allows users to create custom circuit boards quickly and affordably. <br>
It offers services like PCB fabrication, SMT assembly, and component sourcing, making it ideal for both prototyping and small production runs.
<br>Their platform is known for fast turnaround, integration with design tools, and low costs, which makes it especially popular among hobbyists and engineers.
</p>
<h2>What is easyEDA and what is it used for?</h2>
<p>
EasyEDA is an online tool used to design electronic circuits and printed circuit boards (PCBs).<br>
It allows users to draw schematics, create PCB layouts, and simulate circuits all in one place.<br>
Since it connects directly with JLCPCB, users can go from design to manufacturing in just a few clicks.<br> 
It’s beginner-friendly and great for collaborative or cloud-based electronics projects.
</p>
 <h2>What is RAKWIRELESS RAK3112 and what is it used for?</h2>
<p>
The RAK3112 is a compact IoT module that combines LoRa, WiFi, and Bluetooth connectivity with an ESP32-S3 microcontroller.<br>
It’s designed for low-power applications like remote sensors, mesh networks, and edge AI processing.<br> 
With built-in memory and multiple wireless options, it supports versatile communication and local data processing in a small, efficient package.
